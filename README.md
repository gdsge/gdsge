# GDSGE: A Toolbox for Solving Global DSGE Models

## The GDSGE Toolbox

GDSGE is a toolbox that solves nonlinear Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models with a global method based on the Simultaneous Transition and Policy Function Iteration (STPFI) algorithm introduced in [Cao, Luo, and Nie (2020)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3569013). It allows users to define economic models in compact and intuitive scripts, called gmod files (gmod stands for global model). It parses the scripts into dynamic libraries which implement the actual computations (policy function iterations and Monte Carlo simulations) efficiently in C++, and provides a convenient MATLAB interface to researchers.

The toolbox can be used to solve models in macroeconomics, international finance, asset pricing, and related fields.

See the [toolbox website for examples and documentation](http://www.gdsge.com/).

## Requirements for the local compiler

* Windows / macOS

* MATLAB ver>=2017b. MATLAB toolboxes: Symbolic Math, Curve Fitting

* One of the following C++ compilers:
  * Windows: MinGW64 C++ (installed via MATLAB Add-Ons); Visual Studio C++ Compiler 2019, 2022 (community version is fine); Intel C++ Compiler 2017 or newer
  * macOS: g++8.5 (installed via homebrew; see [the instruction for how to setup the g++8.5 compiler](README_compiler_macOS.md))

## Installation of the local compiler

First, Configure your mex C++ compiler by running in MATLAB

  ```matlab
  mex -setup c++
  ```

(For macOS users, see [the instruction for how to setup the g++8.5 compiler](README_compiler_macOS.md).)

Then, acquire the source code by cloning the git repository (*the local folder name should not contain spaces*):

```git
git clone https://github.com/gdsge/gdsge
```

Next, in MATLAB, change directory to gdsge/tests, run

```matlab
runtests
```

which runs all the tests and produce all results in the companion paper [Cao, Luo, and Nie (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094202523000017).

To compile a gmod file, add folder "source" to MATLAB search path and run *gdsge_codegen* after changing the working directory to the one that contains the gmod file. For example, suppose you have located tests/HeatonLucas1996 with HL1996.gmod in the working directory, then simply run 

```matlab
gdsge_codegen('HL1996')
```

which will generate all the source codes and call the C++ compiler to compile the mex files.
